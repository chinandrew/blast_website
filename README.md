# BLAST Working Group Website

This is the repository for the BLAST working group website. It is built on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), using a heavily modified [Hugo Serif Theme](https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/hugo-serif-theme).

Source code for the website is contained in the `master` branch, and a Github Action will build the website to the `gh-pages` branch which is deployed via Github Pages. 
This action runs on push to `master` as well as every night at 5 AM UTC, which lets the Events page recategorize the Upcoming/Past events each day.

## Developing
There are three types of primary content: research, people, events. A new section of each can be generated by running `hugo new <research/people/events>/<filename>.md`, which will populate a templated markdown file in `content/<research/people/events>/<filename.md>` that you can fill out. The templates are contained in the `archetypes/` folder.

Images content belong in `static/`, content that uses images (people, research) can specify the image path within the folder in the front matter.

All changes should by based and merged into `master`, not `gh-pages`. 

More advanced development, such as editing HTML/CSS/Hugo Templates to change formatting, is done in the `assets/` and `layouts/` folder
