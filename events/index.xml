Common examples include random effects models (the random effects are the latent variables) and mixture models (where the component indicators are the latent variables). I will introduce and discuss variational inference (VI) methods for latent variable problems, drawing connections both with Bayesian approaches (Markov Chain Monte Carlo and the maximum a-posteriori estimator) and frequentist approaches (maximum likelihood estimators and the EM algorithm).</description></item><item><title>Spatial meshing for general Bayesian multivariate models</title><link>https://jhublast.github.io/events/20220309/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 14:58:24 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jhublast.github.io/events/20220309/</guid><description>Quantifying spatial associations in multivariate geolocated data of different types is achievable via random effects in a Bayesian hierarchical model, but severe computational bottlenecks arise when spatial dependence is encoded as a latent Gaussian process (GP) in the increasingly common large scale data settings on which we focus. The scenario worsens in non-Gaussian models because the reduced analytical tractability leads to additional hurdles to computational efficiency. We introduce methodologies for efficiently computing multivariate Bayesian models of spatially referenced non-Gaussian data.</description></item><item><title>Recent Experiences Conducting Trials using Bayesian Response Adaptive Randomization</title><link>https://jhublast.github.io/events/20220223/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 14:57:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jhublast.github.io/events/20220223/</guid><description>I will discuss my experiences coordinating two recent clinical trials in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest that used Bayesian response adaptive randomization designs, and present some methodological innovations to improve implementation and understand the potential benefit these designs offer. I will discuss the ACCESS trial (Clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT03119571), which sought to compare the efficacy of two standards or care: direct admission to the cardiac catheter laboratory versus the ICU; and the ARREST trial (NCT03880565), which sought to evaluate the efficacy of in-transit ECMO-facilitated resuscitation versus standard Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) resuscitation.</description></item><item><title>A Bayesian predictive platform design for proof of concept and dose finding using early and late endpoints</title><link>https://jhublast.github.io/events/20220209/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 14:55:53 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jhublast.github.io/events/20220209/</guid><description>Evaluating long-term benefits of potential new treatments for chronic diseases can be very time-consuming and costly. We propose a Bayesian predictive platform design that provides a unified framework for evaluating multiple investigational agents in a multistage, randomized controlled trial. The design expedites the drug evaluation process and reduces development costs by including dose finding, futility and superiority monitoring, and enrichment, while avoiding over-allocating patients to a shared placebo or active control arm.</description></item></channel></rss>
