However, characteristics of the origins and molecular features of cell-free DNA are poorly understood. Here we developed an approach to evaluate fragmentation patterns of cell-free DNA across the genome, and found that profiles of healthy individuals reflected nucleosomal patterns of white blood cells, whereas patients with cancer had altered fragmentation profiles. We used this method to analyse the fragmentation profiles of 236 patients with breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, pancreatic, gastric or bile duct cancer and 245 healthy individuals.</description></item><item><title>Disease Risk Modeling and Visualization using R-INLA</title><link>https://jhublast.github.io/events/20210331/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2022 18:25:13 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jhublast.github.io/events/20210331/</guid><description>Disease risk models are essential to inform public health and policy. These models can be used to quantify disease burden, understand geographic and temporal patterns, identify risk factors, and measure inequalities. In this tutorial we will learn how to estimate disease risk and quantify risk factors using spatial data. We will also create interactive maps of disease risk and risk factors, and introduce presentation options such as interactive dashboards. The tutorial examples will focus on health applications, but the approaches covered are also applicable to other fields that use georeferenced data including ecology, demography or the environment.</description></item><item><title>Reversible Hamiltonian zigzag sampler outperforms its non-reversible competitors to learn correlation among mixed-type biological traits</title><link>https://jhublast.github.io/events/20210428/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2022 17:58:33 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jhublast.github.io/events/20210428/</guid><description>Inferring correlation among multiple continuous and discrete biological traits along an evolutionary history remains an important yet challenging problem. We jointly model these mixed-type traits through data augmentation and a phylogenetic multivariate probit model. With large sample sizes, posterior computation under this model is problematic, as it requires repeated sampling from a high-dimensional truncated Gaussian distribution with strong correlation. For this task, we propose the Hamiltonian zigzag sampler based on Laplace momentum, one state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo method.</description></item><item><title>Generalized Additive Neutral to the Right Regression for Survival Analysis</title><link>https://jhublast.github.io/events/20210512/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2022 17:53:47 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jhublast.github.io/events/20210512/</guid><description>We present a novel Bayesian nonparametric model for regression in survival analysis. The model builds on the neutral to the right model of Doksum (1974) and on the Cox proportional hazards model of Kim and Lee (2003). The use of a vector of dependent Bayesian nonparametric priors allows us to efficiently model the hazard as a function of covariates whilst allowing non-proportionality. Properties of the model and inference schemes will be discussed.</description></item><item><title>Latent Gaussian Model Boosting</title><link>https://jhublast.github.io/events/20211013/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2022 14:19:12 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jhublast.github.io/events/20211013/</guid><description>Latent Gaussian models and boosting are widely used techniques in statistics and machine learning. Tree-boosting shows excellent predictive accuracy on many data sets, but potential drawbacks are that it assumes conditional independence of samples, produces discontinuous predictions for, e.g., spatial data, and it can have difficulty with high-cardinality categorical variables. Latent Gaussian models, such as Gaussian process and grouped random effects models, are flexible prior models that allow for making probabilistic predictions.</description></item><item><title>Variational Methods for Latent Variable Problems: Part I</title><link>https://jhublast.github.io/events/20211027/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Mar 2022 14:18:30 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jhublast.github.io/events/20211027/</guid><description>Many practical problems in statistical inference involve &amp;ldquo;latent&amp;rdquo; variables, by which I will mean high-dimensional, unobserved nuisance parameters or missing data which must be accounted for when performing inference on some lower-dimensional quantity of primary interest. Common examples include random effects models (the random effects are the latent variables) and mixture models (where the component indicators are the latent variables).

The scenario worsens in non-Gaussian models because the reduced analytical tractability leads to additional hurdles to computational efficiency. We introduce methodologies for efficiently computing multivariate Bayesian models of spatially referenced non-Gaussian data.</description></item><item><title>Recent Experiences Conducting Trials using Bayesian Response Adaptive Randomization</title><link>https://jhublast.github.io/events/20220223/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 14:57:14 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jhublast.github.io/events/20220223/</guid><description>I will discuss my experiences coordinating two recent clinical trials in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest that used Bayesian response adaptive randomization designs, and present some methodological innovations to improve implementation and understand the potential benefit these designs offer. I will discuss the ACCESS trial (Clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT03119571), which sought to compare the efficacy of two standards or care: direct admission to the cardiac catheter laboratory versus the ICU; and the ARREST trial (NCT03880565), which sought to evaluate the efficacy of in-transit ECMO-facilitated resuscitation versus standard Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) resuscitation.</description></item><item><title>A Bayesian predictive platform design for proof of concept and dose finding using early and late endpoints</title><link>https://jhublast.github.io/events/20220209/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2022 14:55:53 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://jhublast.github.io/events/20220209/</guid><description>Evaluating long-term benefits of potential new treatments for chronic diseases can be very time-consuming and costly. We propose a Bayesian predictive platform design that provides a unified framework for evaluating multiple investigational agents in a multistage, randomized controlled trial. The design expedites the drug evaluation process and reduces development costs by including dose finding, futility and superiority monitoring, and enrichment, while avoiding over-allocating patients to a shared placebo or active control arm.</description></item></channel></rss>
