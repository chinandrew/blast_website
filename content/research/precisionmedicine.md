For a specific disease and clinical question of interest, a single data source rarely provide a sufficient number of patients, longitudinal coverage, and breadth of information. Generating actionable clinical insights on how to treat individual patients necessitates integrating patient experiences across multiple data sources. Bayesian inference provides a natural framework to account for the hierarchical structure of such data as well as to incorporate our scientific understanding of the underlying clinical and biological processes. We build Bayesian machinery and software to support enterprises such as the Johns Hopkins's [inHealth](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/inhealth/) Precision Medicine initiative and the [Observational Health Data Science and Informatics](https://ohdsi.org/) collaborative.

Hopkins's participation in the GAP3 global database provides an opportunity to further improve individual-level prediction through Bayesian hierarchical modeling.)
