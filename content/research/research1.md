A central application of spatial statistics is using geographically sparsely sampled data to create spatially continuous maps for policy-making. For example, the figure shows how the PM10 data from a small number of monitoring stations in Europe (left) are used to predict the pollutant's distribution across the region (middle) as well as the probability of it exceeding the regulatory threshold (right).
