A central application of spatial statistics is to use geographically sparsely sampled data (like PM10 data from few monitoring stations in Europe in the left figure) to create different types of spatially continuous maps used for policy-making (like map of predicted PM10 in the middle Figure, and map of tail probability of predicted PM10 distribution exceeding the regulatory threshold in right Figure).
