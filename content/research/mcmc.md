Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) has been an essential tool for Bayesian statistics, empowering posterior inference for otherwise intractable probabilistic models. While alternatives have emerged, MCMC remains one of the most reliable and broadly applicable approaches to characterize complex posterior distributions common in modern biomedical/public health applications. We push computational limits of Bayesian inference in the era of Big Data through fundamental innovations in MCMC and other computational algorithms.

(Figure: the novel ["zigzag" variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07694) enables statistical phylogenetics software [BEAST](https://beast.community/) to infer correlation among relations between gene mutations and biological traits of viruses.)
