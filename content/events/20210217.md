Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for Bayesian computation, forming a backbone of popular Bayesian inference software packages such as Stan and PyMC. Even though these packages automate posterior computation for users, basic understanding of HMC remains essential to obtain best computational performances out of these packages. For example, HMC --- and hence software based on it --- is highly sensitive to model parametrization. In this tutorial, I will explain inner workings of HMC and its implementations that are most relevant to its practical performances.
