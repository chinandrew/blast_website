This talk will discuss some recent approaches to speed up MCMC for large stationary time series data via data subsampling. We discuss the Whittle log-likelihood for univariate time series and some properties that allow estimating the log-likelihood via data subsampling. We also consider an extension to multivariate time series via the multivariate Whittle log-likelihood and propose a novel model that parsimoniously models semi-long memory properties of multivariate time series.
