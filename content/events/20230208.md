The Zig Zag sampler and other MCMC schemes based on the simulation of Piecewise Deterministic Markov Processes (PDMPs) have been attracting increasing interest mainly due to their appealing super-efficiency property. An algorithm is said to be super-efficient when it draws one independent sample from a posterior target distribution at a lesser cost than evaluating the likelihood of all the N data points.
This property is based on the technique of subsampling, whereby only one or a few of the N components of the likelihood are needed for the simulation of each step of the process, whilst still retaining convergence to the correct target distribution.
Until recently, super-efficiency has been implemented only in few simple cases. In this talk I will start by introducing PDMPs, the Zig Zag algorithm and its practical implementation; I will then illustrate a way to obtain super efficiency automatically, given any differentiable posterior distribution of interest. I will present one example of the efficient analysis of big data, and I will describe key tuning decisions that are involved in the implementation of an automatic super-efficient PDMP sampler.
