The Bouncy Particle Sampler is among the most prominent examples of piecewise deterministic Markov process samplers, a state-of-the-art paradigm in Bayesian computation. Inspired by recent connections to the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo paradigm, we present a Monte Carlo algorithm intimately related to the Bouncy Particle Sampler but relying on Hamiltonian-like dynamics which generate a piecewise linear trajectory similar to the Bouncy Particle Sampler's. However, changes in its velocity occur deterministically in the manner of Hamiltonian dynamics, dictated by the auxiliary "inertia" parameter we introduce. We show that the proposed dynamics, while technically non-Hamiltonian, are reversible and volume-preserving and thus constitute a valid Metropolis proposal mechanism. They can be simulated exactly on log-concave target distributions, easily accommodate parameter constraints, and require minimal tuning. We further establish that the dynamics converge to the Bouncy Particle Sampler in the limit of increasingly frequent inertia refreshment. In this talk we first introduce Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and the Bouncy Particle Sampler. Then we describe our algorithm, which we call the Hamiltonian Bouncy Particle Sampler, and demonstrate its performance on real-data applications in observational health data analytics and phylogenetics.
