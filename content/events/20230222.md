An overview of the Infectious Disease Dynamics (IDD) modeling group's research portfolio, with short talks highlighting ongoing work and discussion of possible collaborations. The IDD is made up of faculty, post-docs, graduate and undergraduate students who are interested in the dynamics of a wide span of infectious diseases, from dengue to influenza to chikungunya, based at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The group uses a combination of theoretical and empirical approaches to study transmission dynamics.
