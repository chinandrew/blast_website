Disease risk models are essential to inform public health and policy. These models can be used to quantify disease burden, understand geographic and temporal patterns, identify risk factors, and measure inequalities. In this tutorial we will learn how to estimate disease risk and quantify risk factors using spatial data. We will also create interactive maps of disease risk and risk factors, and introduce presentation options such as interactive dashboards. The tutorial examples will focus on health applications, but the approaches covered are also applicable to other fields that use georeferenced data including ecology, demography or the environment. The workshop materials are drawn from the book 'Geospatial Health Data: Modeling and Visualization with R-INLA and Shiny' by Paula Moraga (2019, Chapman & Hall/CRC).
