Inferring correlation among multiple continuous and discrete biological traits along an evolutionary history remains an important yet challenging problem. We jointly model these mixed-type traits through data augmentation and a phylogenetic multivariate probit model. With large sample sizes, posterior computation under this model is problematic, as it requires repeated sampling from a high-dimensional truncated Gaussian distribution with strong correlation. For this task, we propose the Hamiltonian zigzag sampler based on Laplace momentum, one state-of-the-art Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The reversible Hamiltonian zigzag sampler achieves better efficiency than its non-reversible competitors including the Markovian zigzag sampler and the bouncy particle sampler that is the best current approach for sampling latent parameters in the phylogenetic probit model. In an application with 535HIV viruses and 24 traits that necessitates sampling from a 12,840-dimensional truncated normal, our method makes it possible to estimate the across-trait correlation and detect association between immune escape mutations and the pathogenâ€™s capacity to cause disease.
