COVID-19 has challenged health systems to learn how to learn. This talk describes the context and methods for learning from EHR data at one academic health center. We use Bayesian hierarchical regression to jointly model 1) major survival outcomes including discharge, ventilation, and death, and 2) multivariate biomarker processes that describe a patientâ€™s disease trajectory. We focus on dynamic models using Bayesian machinery in which both the predictors and survival outcomes vary over time. We contrast prospective longitudinal models in common use with retrospective analogues that are complementary in the COVID-19 context. We apply the method to a cohort of 1,678 patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 during the early months of the pandemic. The Bayesian dynamics model facilitates physician
learning and clinical decision making through graphical tools.
