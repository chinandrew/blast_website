Stan is a probabilistic programming language, designed primarily for Bayesian inference. Its main algorithm is an adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler, supported by a state-of-the-art automatic differentiation library. Beyond model fitting, the Stan framework is designed to support a comprehensive modeling workflow. Using a simple example, I'll demonstrate how to code and run a model in Stan; how to analyze samples from our posterior distribution using various diagnostics such as posterior predictive checks; and, based on these diagnoses, how to improve our model. This talk includes live-coding in R and Stan, and participants are welcomed to code along.
