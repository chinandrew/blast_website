Bayesian hypothesis testing procedures have gained increased acceptance in recent years.  A key advantage of Bayesian tests over classical testing procedures is their potential to quantify information supporting true null hypotheses.  Ironically, default implementations of Bayesian tests prevent the accumulation of strong evidence in favor of true null hypotheses because associated default alternative hypotheses assign a high probability to data that are most consistent with a null effect.  We propose the use of "non-local" alternative hypotheses to resolve this paradox.  The resulting class of Bayesian hypothesis tests permits a more rapid accumulation of evidence in favor of both true null hypotheses and alternative hypotheses that are compatible with standardized effect sizes of most interest in psychology.
