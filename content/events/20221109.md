Several biomarkers are hypothesized to indicate early stagesof Alzheimer’s disease, well before the cognitive symptoms manifest. Theirprecise relations to the disease progression, however, is poorly understood.This limits our ability to diagnose the disease and intervene at early stages.To better quantify how the disease and biomarkers progress, we propose a jointmodel in which biomarkers are modeled as increasing functions of a latentdisease progression parameter. In estimating these functions, we deploymonotone regression splines with smoothness penalty to flexibly model increasingfunctions. Besides their monotonic property, the biomarkers are expected to“flatten out” before the onset of and at the end stage of the disease. Weincorporate this scientifically-motivated shape-constraint through a “windowfunction” that controls the prior variances on splines near the two ends of thedisease progression. We fit this joint, monotone regression model under theBayesian framework to avoid having to tune the large number of hyper-parametersand to allow for a future hierarchical extension to multi-database settings.The model fit to the BIOCARD data recovers the biomarkers progressionsgenerally consistent with the existing scientific hypotheses.
