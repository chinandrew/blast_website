For example, the figure shows how the PM10 data from a small number of monitoring stations in Europe (left) are used to predict the pollutant&amp;rsquo;s distribution across the region (middle) as well as the probability of it exceeding the regulatory threshold (right).

While alternatives have emerged, MCMC remains one of the most reliable and broadly applicable approaches to characterize complex posterior distributions common in modern biomedical/public health applications. We push computational limits of Bayesian inference in the era of Big Data through fundamental innovations in MCMC and other computational algorithms.

Generating actionable clinical insights on how to treat individual patients necessitates integrating patient experiences across multiple data sources. Bayesian inference provides a natural framework to account for the hierarchical structure of such data as well as to incorporate our scientific understanding of the underlying clinical and biological processes.</description></item></channel></rss>
